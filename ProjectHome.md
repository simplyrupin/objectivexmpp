This project is originally based on code from http://code.google.com/p/xmppframework the major difference is that it is based on Core Networking (found at http://code.google.com/p/amber-framework) making it much easier to use and more flexible. It also includes a rudimentary server object.

Though the framework is named ObjectiveXMPP it reserves the XMPP prefix for classes and categories.
